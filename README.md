## Overview

Our motivation for building this project was to give our classmates and staff accurate mortgage information. The Mortgage Repayment Calculator was built to give the user the option of an independent morgage calculation solution that they can utilize when making decisions about their home and money. During this process we learned how we already had was tremendiously helped by utilizing Bootstrap, which really cleared it up.

### The challenge

The challenge was creating an application and website the Users could and should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- bootstrap
- Agile development

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

During this we learned most about git item to set item, debugging formatting from our instructor, as well as how to use localStorage.

### Continued development

This project intended to continue development by building out features including credit history, unemployment status and eveny other metric commonly uses in the mortgage industry.

### Useful resources

- W3 Schools (w3schools.com) was helpful in learing about localStorage
- MDN Web Docs (developer.mozilla.org) also was more informative about localStorage
- Oracle provide help with the right item syntax
